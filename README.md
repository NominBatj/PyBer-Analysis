# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graphs that will show the total weekly fares for each city type. We are using Matplotlib for making different types of plots, such as line, bar, scatter, box-and-whisker plots etc.

## Results 
Here is the results of analysis:
- Rural cities have the lowest number of drivers, trips and total fares.
- Urban cities have the highest number of drivers, trips and overall fares.
- Suburban cities rank second in terms of the number of drivers, trips and total fare.
- Although rural cities have the lowest number of drivers, trips and fares, they have the highest average fares per trip and fares per driver.
- Although urban cities have the most drivers, trips and fares, they have the lowest average fare per trip and fare per driver.

## Summary
Based on our data, we can tell which fares will apply depending on the type of city the passenger travels to. We can determine the rates that will need to be charged after we can classify which city the consumer lives in. There are fewer workers who will be coming to the area, travel times and distances are likely to be longer, making the average cost per trip and driver the highest of any city type.
